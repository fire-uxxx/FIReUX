## üß† Multi-Tenant SaaS: Flexible Approaches

FIReUX is designed with scalability in mind. Whether you're serving one client or 100, the system supports multiple tenant strategies depending on your business model and technical preference.

### üîÄ Multi-Tenant Options

#### 1. **Separate Firebase Projects (Recommended for Freelancers & Agencies)**

This model is ideal if each client needs full data separation and independent hosting.

**Steps:**

- Create a new Firebase project per client (e.g., `coolcleaners`, `fastlaundrypro`).
- Deploy a fresh instance of the FIReUX app.
- Use a unique Firestore DB and Auth system for each client.
- Assign `isAdmin = true` to your client's account in their Firestore.

This ensures full data and permission isolation with minimal complexity.

#### 2. **Single Firebase Project, Multiple Apps (Advanced)**

This model allows multiple tenants to share a single Firebase backend, using custom `appId` claims or document partitioning.

**Strategies:**

- Use custom claims (e.g. `{ appId: 'coolcleaners' }`) to scope user access.
- Prefix or nest documents by `appId` in Firestore:
  ```
  apps/{appId}/users/{userId}
  apps/{appId}/jobs/{jobId}
  apps/{appId}/products/{productId}
  ```
- Apply Firestore Rules to restrict access by `appId`:
  ```firestore
  match /apps/{appId}/{collection}/{docId} {
    allow read, write: if request.auth.token.appId == appId;
  }
  ```

‚ö†Ô∏è This approach requires strict rule management and deeper familiarity with Firebase security.

#### 3. **Hybrid: Core Engine + Tenant Forks**

If you're selling this as a SaaS template:

- Keep a core repo (like this one).
- Fork it per client or offer it as a white-label package.
- Optionally, automate deployments via scripts or CI/CD pipelines.

---

### üîí Admin Setup

Regardless of model, FIReUX supports optional admin control via PIN and onboarding flow. You can:

- Set `isAdmin = true` for a user after sign-up.
- Restrict access to certain parts of the app unless `isAdmin` is true.
- Use onboarding to pre-register app-specific metadata (logo, site name, etc.).

---

### üß™ Custom Claims for Context

On sign-up, FIReUX sets a custom claim:

```json
{ "appId": "fireux" }
```

You can modify this logic to dynamically apply `appId` or role-based access (`isAdmin`, `plan`, etc.).

---

This flexibility allows you to grow from a single-template MVP to a full SaaS platform, at your own pace.

## üöÄ Stripe Integration & Product Creation

FIReUX now includes a streamlined product creation flow integrated with Stripe. This setup allows you to:

- **Create Products:** Use our custom product creation page to add products with details such as name, description, price, image, and active status. The form sends data to a dedicated API endpoint (`/api/create-stripe-product`), which creates the product and its price on Stripe and writes a record to Firestore.

- **Real-Time Sync with Firestore:**
  Products created via the UI are stored in Firestore, enabling real-time updates and easy querying on your product page.

- **Secure Stripe Integration:**
  We recommend using a **restricted API key** for Stripe. When creating this key in your Stripe dashboard, select the option that best describes your use case: **"You're using this key in a project you're building."** Grant write permissions (which include read access) for Products and Prices. Optionally, enable additional permissions (such as Customers or Checkout Sessions) if your project evolves.

- **Environment Variables:**
  Update your `.env` file with your Stripe keys:

  ```env
  # Stripe Keys
  STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key
  STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
  ```

This integration leverages our existing Firebase & Stripe-powered architecture, keeping your user data secure and providing a smooth product management experience. As you scale, you can further customize and extend these features to suit your multi-tenant SaaS needs.

## üîê Stripe Webhook Setup for SaaS + Multi‚ÄëTenant (FIReUX)

This project supports multi‚Äëapp product enrichment by listening to Stripe webhooks and storing metadata in Firestore.

1. ‚úÖ Securely Store Your Webhook Secret

   Instead of `.env`, use Firebase‚Äôs Secret Manager:

   ```sh
   firebase functions:secrets:set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
   ```

   Paste in your Stripe secret (starts with `whsec_...`).

2. üîÅ Configure Endpoint in Stripe Dashboard

   In your Stripe Dashboard:

   - Go to **Developers ‚Üí Webhooks**
   - Click **Add endpoint**
   - **URL:**
     ```text
     https://us-central1-<your-project>.cloudfunctions.net/stripeWebhook
     ```
   - Select relevant events (e.g. `product.created`)
   - Save and copy the signing secret into your Firebase Secret.

3. üß† How Multi‚ÄëTenant Enrichment Works

   When creating products via Stripe, attach metadata to identify the app + user:

   ```js
   metadata: {
     appId: 'fireux',
     createdBy: 'user_abc123'
   }
   ```

   Our webhook listens for `product.created` and writes to Firestore:

   ```text
   /products/{stripeProductId} ‚Üí {
     appId,
     createdBy,
     createdAt,
     ‚Ä¶
   }
   ```

   This allows filtering and SaaS segregation of products in both frontend and backend.
## üîê Required Firebase Secret: `APP_ID`

Before deploying functions, you **must set the `APP_ID` secret** in your Firebase project. This is critical for identifying the app environment during webhook processing (e.g., Stripe product enrichment).

### ‚úÖ How to Set It

Run this from the root of your project:

```bash
firebase functions:secrets:set APP_ID
```

When prompted, enter your internal app identifier, e.g.:

```
fireux
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If this secret is not set, Stripe webhooks (like `product.created`) will fail silently or log errors.

### üß™ Verify the Secret

You can confirm the value at any time with:

```bash
firebase functions:secrets:access APP_ID
```

This should return:

```
"fireux"
```

### üõ† When to Run

- After cloning the project
- When setting up a new Firebase project
- Before deploying functions that depend on `APP_ID`
