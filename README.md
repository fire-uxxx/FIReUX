## üß† Multi-Tenant SaaS: Flexible Approaches

FIReUX is designed with scalability in mind. Whether you're serving one client or 100, the system supports multiple tenant strategies depending on your business model and technical preference.

### üîÄ Multi-Tenant Options

#### 1. **Separate Firebase Projects (Recommended for Freelancers & Agencies)**

This model is ideal if each client needs full data separation and independent hosting.

**Steps:**

- Create a new Firebase project per client (e.g., `coolcleaners`, `fastlaundrypro`).
- Deploy a fresh instance of the FIReUX app.
- Use a unique Firestore DB and Auth system for each client.
- Assign `isAdmin = true` to your client's account in their Firestore.

This ensures full data and permission isolation with minimal complexity.

#### 2. **Single Firebase Project, Multiple Apps (Advanced)**

This model allows multiple tenants to share a single Firebase backend, using custom `appId` claims or document partitioning.

**Strategies:**

- Use custom claims (e.g. `{ appId: 'coolcleaners' }`) to scope user access.
- Prefix or nest documents by `appId` in Firestore:
  ```
  apps/{appId}/users/{userId}
  apps/{appId}/jobs/{jobId}
  ```
- Apply Firestore Rules to restrict access by `appId`.

‚ö†Ô∏è This approach requires strict rule management and deeper familiarity with Firebase security.

#### 3. **Hybrid: Core Engine + Tenant Forks**

If you're selling this as a SaaS template:

- Keep a core repo (like this one).
- Fork it per client or offer it as a white-label package.
- Optionally, automate deployments via scripts or CI/CD pipelines.

---

### üîí Admin Setup

Regardless of model, FIReUX supports optional admin control via PIN and onboarding flow. You can:

- Set `isAdmin = true` for a user after sign-up.
- Restrict access to certain parts of the app unless `isAdmin` is true.
- Use onboarding to pre-register app-specific metadata (logo, site name, etc.).

---

### üß™ Custom Claims for Context

On sign-up, FIReUX sets a custom claim:

```json
{ "appId": "fireux" }
```

You can modify this logic to dynamically apply `appId` or role-based access (`isAdmin`, `plan`, etc.).

---

This flexibility allows you to grow from a single-template MVP to a full SaaS platform, at your own pace.
