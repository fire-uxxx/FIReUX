Create a .env file in the project root with the following contents (replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials):

# Firebase Admin Credentials
# IMPORTANT: Use the real (absolute) path for the service account file.
# You can obtain the real path by running:
#    realpath config/service-account.json
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/absolute/path/to/your/project/config/service-account.json

# Firebase Configuration
FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY

# Node Environment & Frontend URL
NODE_ENV=development
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

4. Firebase Service Account

Make sure the file config/service-account.json exists and is correctly formatted.

5. Firebase Hosting & Project Configuration

Update the following files:
	•	firebase.json – Replace placeholders with your project details:

    {
      "site": "todo-my-site",
      "public": ".output/public",
      "cleanUrls": true,

  "projects": {
    "default": "todo-my-project"
  }
}



6. Project Metadata Update

In package.json, update the "name" field:

{
  "name": "todo-my-name",
  ...
}

7. Update Nuxt PWA Manifest

In nuxt.config.js, update the PWA manifest section:

pwa: {
  registerType: 'autoUpdate',

    ]
  },
  workbox: {
    navigateFallback: '/',
    cleanupOutdatedCaches: true,
    clientsClaim: true,
    skipWaiting: true
  },
  devOptions: {
    enabled: false
  }
}

8. Run the Development Server

npm run dev

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to test the app.

9. Build & Deploy (Firebase)
	•	Build the Application:
